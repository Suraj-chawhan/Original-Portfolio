Thanks for sharing your resume. Here’s a quick review of it with suggestions for improvement:

---

### ✅ **What’s Good:**

* **Clear Skills Section:** You've effectively listed relevant programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
* **Project-Based Portfolio:** You included multiple projects with GitHub links, which is excellent for showcasing your work.
* **Concise Education Info:** Well-formatted and includes relevant coursework.
* **Relevant Tech Stack:** Modern tools like React, Next.js, Firebase, etc., are good to see for a developer resume.

---

### ⚠️ **Areas for Improvement:**

#### 1. **Formatting & Visual Hierarchy**

* The resume currently lacks clear structure and formatting (e.g., inconsistent line breaks and alignment).
* Use bullet points consistently, proper spacing, and section headers with bold or slightly larger fonts.

#### 2. **Profile Section Missing**

* Add a short professional summary (2–3 lines) at the top to introduce yourself and your goals.

#### 3. **Project Descriptions**

* While you describe features well, use **action verbs** and clarify your **specific contributions**:

  * Instead of “Developed custom audio player components...”, say “Designed and implemented a custom audio player in Next.js, enhancing UX for 50+ tracks.”

#### 4. **Experience**

* “Soven Developer (2 months)” is vague. Specify your role and what you worked on: e.g., “Built responsive web components in React, collaborated on backend APIs with Node.js.”

#### 5. **Typos & Grammar**

* Fix small grammar issues:

  * “allowing users to sign up, log in...” → capitalize first words in bullet points.
  * “Used Firebase Storage to securely store application files uploaded by users.” — consider “Securely stored user-uploaded application files using Firebase Storage.”
  * “all llm” → “all LLMs (Large Language Models)”

#### 6. **Extraneous URLs**

* At the bottom, some links seem duplicated or unclear (e.g., `http://www.ainzx.com`). Clarify or remove if not relevant.
